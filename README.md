### Data Preparation and Cleaning
In this phase, the dataset undergoes thorough cleaning and preparation to ensure accurate analysis. Steps include handling missing values, checking and adjusting data types, and addressing any anomalies that could affect the clustering process.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves examining the dataset's columns, assessing unique values, and visualizing distributions. This step provides initial insights into customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and potential correlations between variables.

### Feature Engineering
Feature Engineering enriches the dataset by creating new features that may enhance clustering accuracy. This project includes consolidating marital statuses and defining relationship statuses to provide additional dimensions for segmentation analysis.

### K-Means Clustering
K-means clustering is applied to segment customers based on their spending habits across various product categories and demographic characteristics. Key steps include:

-Standardizing Data: Scaling numerical features to ensure each feature contributes equally to the clustering process.
-Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Dimensionality reduction technique to visualize high-dimensional data and improve clustering performance.
-Determining Optimal Number of Clusters: Using methods such as the elbow method or silhouette score to identify the optimal number of clusters that best represent the data.
-Cluster Visualization: Visualizing clusters in reduced dimensions (e.g., PCA components) to interpret and understand customer segments effectively.

## Results
The project identified four distinct customer segments characterized by their unique purchasing behaviors and demographic profiles. Each cluster exhibits specific traits that businesses can leverage to tailor marketing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion
Customer segmentation through K-means clustering provides actionable insights that enable businesses to optimize marketing efforts, improve customer retention, and drive overall business growth. By understanding customer preferences and behaviors, businesses can foster stronger relationships and deliver more personalized experiences.

## Project Details
## Introduction
Credit card fraud poses significant challenges for financial institutions and consumers alike. Detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time is crucial to minimize financial losses and maintain trust. This project explores various machine learning techniques to build and evaluate models that can automate the detection process.

## Project structure
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It contains numerical input variables obtained through PCA transformation due to confidentiality issues. Key features include 'Time' (seconds elapsed between transactions) and 'Amount' (transaction amount), with the target variable 'Class' indicating fraud (1) or non-fraud (0).
