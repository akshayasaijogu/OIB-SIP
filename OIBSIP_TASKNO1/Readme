## Introduction

The objective of this project is to segment customers into distinct groups using K-means clustering, a popular
unsupervised machine learning technique. By doing so, businesses can better understand their customer base and
target them with personalized marketing strategies.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

In this phase, the dataset undergoes thorough cleaning and preparation to ensure accurate analysis. Steps include
handling missing values, checking and adjusting data types, and addressing any anomalies that could affect the
clustering process.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves examining the dataset's columns, assessing unique values, and visualizing
distributions. This step provides initial insights into customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and potential
correlations between variables.

## Feature Engineering

Feature Engineering enriches the dataset by creating new features that may enhance clustering accuracy. This project 
includes consolidating marital statuses and defining relationship statuses to provide additional dimensions for
segmentation analysis.

## K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering is applied to segment customers based on their spending habits across various product categories 
and demographic characteristics. Key steps include:

- **Standardizing Data**: Scaling numerical features to ensure each feature contributes equally to the clustering process.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction technique to visualize high-dimensional data and 
   improve clustering performance.
- **Determining Optimal Number of Clusters**: Using methods such as the elbow method or silhouette score to identify 
the optimal number of clusters that best represent the data.
- **Cluster Visualization**: Visualizing clusters in reduced dimensions (e.g., PCA components) to interpret and understand
customer segments effectively.

## Results

The project identified four distinct customer segments characterized by their unique purchasing behaviors and demographic 
profiles. Each cluster exhibits specific traits that businesses can leverage to tailor marketing strategies and enhance
customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion

Customer segmentation through K-means clustering provides actionable insights that enable businesses to optimize marketing
efforts, improve customer retention, and drive overall business growth. By understanding customer preferences and behaviors,
businesses can foster stronger relationships and deliver more personalized experiences.
